`barkeep` is a home bartending application that tracks your liquor cabinet and recommends
cocktail recipes for you.

You can view the running application at [barkeep.website](https://barkeep.website).

I am blogging about my work on this app here: [https://edbrown23.github.io/blog/](https://edbrown23.github.io/blog/)
